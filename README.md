This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# react-test

In the folder /api there is a serve. 

* For this server I have used the library json-server that provides a db.json file that allows you to create simple api calls.

In the folder /bitmodern there is a react app, that uses React Router to navigate. 

* The app allows you to create a new book and list all the books. 
React creates and fetch the data through the library axios that lets you make api calls. 
Everything has been implemented using redux, and the api calls are async, so as you might know you can't make async calls using redux, so I have to use this middleware library called Thunk in order to make it work.
For the react router you can find clicking routes by the user and also I used the history library contained in react-router-dom in order to route to a page not just when the user clicks, also when there is an internal navigation coming from the app.

## Installation
## Server side
Inside the /api folder run the command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server runs in http://localhost:3001

## Frontend side
Inside the /bitmodern folder run the command:
```bash
npm start
```
the app is launch at the default react settings http://localhost:3000
